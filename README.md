# First-Project
First project using Twitter Bootstrap
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author: Martynas Mockapetris
<p>My first project where I finally applied Twitter Bootstrap classes. Even though I felt in love with grid system, carousels and its incredible responsivness, I was having a hard time seeing that so much unused code was dragged along side.</p>
<p>Thesedays I prefer to use minified alternatives like "Skeleton" to replace Bootstrap, but all in all Bootstrap comparing its cons and pros is a great tool to quickly build decent landing pages across all platforms. I am sure I will be working with Bootstrap more later on when I will implement UnCSS feature to my work environment.</p>
